## 📚 Data Sources

This library queries [Leaguepedia's Cargo tables](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables) - a structured database of League of Legends esports data.

### Cargo Table Mapping

| Function | Cargo Table | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `get_tournaments()` | Tournaments, Leagues | Tournament metadata |
| `get_games()` | ScoreboardGames | Match results and stats |
| `get_game_details()` | ScoreboardGames, ScoreboardPlayers, PicksAndBansS7 | Full match data with players |
| `get_player_by_name()` | Players | Player profiles (49 fields) |
| `get_active_players()` | Tenures, RosterChanges | Current team rosters |
| `get_standings()` | Standings | Tournament rankings |
| `get_champions()` | Champions | Champion stats and attributes |
| `get_items()` | Items | Item stats and costs |
| `get_roster_changes()` | RosterChanges | Player transfers |
| `get_contracts()` | Contracts | Player contract dates |
| `get_scoreboard_players()` | ScoreboardPlayers | Individual match performance |
| `get_tournament_rosters()` | TournamentRosters | Tournament team compositions |

### Tournament Naming Convention

Tournaments use the `OverviewPage` format: `{League}/{Year} Season/{Split}`

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `LCK/2024 Season/Summer Season` | LCK Summer 2024 |
| `LEC/2024 Season/Spring Season` | LEC Spring 2024 |
| `Worlds/2024 Season/Main Event` | Worlds 2024 Main Event |
| `MSI/2024 Season/Main Event` | MSI 2024 |

**Tip:** Use `get_tournaments(region, year)` to discover valid tournament names.

### Field Availability

Not all fields are always populated. Common optional fields:

| Dataclass | Optional Fields |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `PlayerInfo` | `birthdate`, `contract`, social media fields, `team` (if free agent) |
| `Champion` | `release_date`, some stat fields for newer champions |
| `ScoreboardPlayer` | `damage_to_champions`, `vision_score` (older matches) |
| `Contract` | `contract_end_text`, `news_id` |

Always check for `None` before using these fields.

### Rate Limiting

Leaguepedia has rate limits. Best practices:

- **Use `limit` parameter** - Don't fetch more data than needed
- **Filter by tournament** - Avoid unbounded queries across all history
- **Add delays for bulk operations** - 1-2 seconds between large queries
- **Expect occasional timeouts** - The library retries automatically (3 attempts)

```python
# Good - bounded query
games = mp.get_games("LCK/2024 Season/Summer Season", limit=10)

# Slow - unbounded, fetches years of data
games = mp.get_games()  # Avoid this
```

### Caching

For heavy usage, enable HTTP-level caching to avoid repeated API calls. The library provides built-in support via `requests-cache`.

**Installation:**

```bash
# Install with cache support
pip install meeps[cache]

# Or add requests-cache separately
pip install requests-cache
```

**Built-in cache support:**

```python
import meeps as mp

# Enable caching (SQLite backend, 1 hour TTL)
mp.enable_cache()

# First call hits the API
standings = mp.get_tournament_standings("LCK/2024 Season/Summer Season")

# Second call returns cached data instantly
standings = mp.get_tournament_standings("LCK/2024 Season/Summer Season")

# Check cache status
print(mp.get_cache_info())
# {'size': 1, 'backend': 'SQLiteCache', 'expire_after': 3600}

# Clear cache when you need fresh data
mp.clear_cache()

# Disable caching
mp.disable_cache()
```

**Configuration options:**

```python
# Custom TTL (24 hours)
mp.enable_cache(expire_after=86400)

# In-memory cache (faster, not persistent)
mp.enable_cache(backend='memory')

# Custom cache location
mp.enable_cache(cache_dir='/path/to/cache')

# No expiration (manual clear only)
mp.enable_cache(expire_after=None)
```

**Manual approach (without built-in support):**

```python
import requests_cache

# Install cache before importing meeps
requests_cache.install_cache('leaguepedia_cache', expire_after=3600)

import meeps as mp
# All requests are now cached automatically
```

**Recommended TTLs by data type:**

| Data Type | Suggested TTL | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Champions, Items | 1 week (604800s) | Rarely changes |
| Tournament standings | 1-6 hours | Updates after matches |
| Match schedules | 1 hour | Can change day-of |
| Roster changes | 1 day (86400s) | Updates periodically |
| Live/recent matches | 5-15 minutes | Frequent updates |

## 📋 Data Types

| Module | Returns | Key Properties |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Performance** | `ScoreboardPlayer` | kda_ratio, performance_grade, kill_participation, gold_share |
| **Contracts** | `Contract` | player, team, contract_end, is_active, days_until_expiry |
| **Games** | `Game`, `GameDetails` | teams, winner, date, picks_bans |
| **Teams** | `TeamPlayer`, `TeamAssets` | name, role, logo, thumbnail |
| **Players** | `PlayerInfo` | name, country, birth_date, status |
| **Tournaments** | `Dict` (rosters) | team, tournament, player, role |
| **Standings** | `Standing` | team, place, win_rate, total_games |
| **Champions** | `Champion` | name, attributes, is_ranged, attack_range |
| **Items** | `Item` | name, tier, provides_ad/ap, total_cost |
| **Roster Changes** | `RosterChange` | player, team, direction, is_addition |

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

**For optimal performance with large datasets:**

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use filters and limits for responsive queries
faker_recent = mp.get_player_match_history("Faker", limit=10)
t1_lck = mp.get_team_match_performance("T1", tournament="LCK/2024 Season/Summer Season")
specific_game = mp.get_game_scoreboard("ESPORTSTMNT01_2024_LCK_Game123")

# ⚠️ SLOW: Large unbounded queries (10+ years of data)
# all_faker_games = mp.get_player_match_history("Faker")  # Takes minutes!
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always use `limit` for exploratory analysis
- Filter by `tournament` for recent data
- Use specific `game_id` for detailed match analysis
- Start with small queries then expand scope as needed
